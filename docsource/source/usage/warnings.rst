Warnings

Before using the delete feature please try a few dry runs to get acquainted with ussocdata as it can irreparably damage your stuff when not used properly.

When using the -del flag here is the expected behavior:

Do this:

.. code-block:: bash

    ussocdata foo -del

To delete all of the stuff

Again, please try a few dry runs without -del until you are acquainted with ussocdata.
